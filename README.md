Was it easy to complete the task using AI?
it was not difficult except for some moments when the AI suggested old libraries.

How long did task take you to complete?
Approximately 2 hours.

Was the code ready to run after generation? What did you have to change to make it usable?

The initial setup code was not ready to run. I had some exceptions related to libs like
Javax persistence instead of Jakarta. And also minor changes were needed for dependency versions.


Which challenges did you face during completion of the task?
Mysql setup, ensuring all dependencies were correctly added and AI did not generate a test for the controller,
had to ask extra.

Which specific prompts you learned as a good practice to complete the task?
Prompting for specific annotations and dependency versions for Spring Boot setup.
